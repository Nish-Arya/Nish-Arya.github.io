Petgram is a clone of the popular social media application 'Instagram'. Instagram is a secure platform where users can sign-up, upload pictures, and view what other people have uploaded. Users can then like and comment on the posts they like. Petgram will try to emulate as much functionality as Instagram as possible, with the only difference being Petgram is for Pets!
